# Team Resources

### Hello Friends, and welcome to the resources folder. Here, our Meetup can share our favorite resources!

**To contribute a resource:**
- Navigate to the resource topic folder it belongs to (if it doesn't exist, create it!)
- If it is a file, commit it inside its topic folder
- If it is a snippet of text (like a link to a website), add it to the README.md file!
